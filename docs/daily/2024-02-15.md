fixed a few bugs that ment the app never updated. finished copying over the sample code from the Direct3D 12 sample demo, but i have not managed to get it working. support for Visual Studio Graphics Analyzer seems deprecated, i am forced to learn PIX. still unsure how i am supposed to plan this project.
