[Asynchronous reprojection/asynchronous timewarp/asynchronous spacewarp](async-reprojection) is a very important rendering technique in virtual reality to keep the framerate at acceptable levels even when the GPU is struggling to maintain high performance. Failing to maintain a comfortable framerate results in motion sickness. 

I first gained attention of the technique from [2kliksphilip's](https://www.youtube.com/@2kliksphilip) [video](https://youtu.be/f8piCZz0p-Y?si=sLsfe4aLPxUUyD9O) showing off [Comrade Stinger's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyeH4DRL7Ik2oJ3Czsn2Elg) demo project. While adoption of async reprojection is a necessity in the VR space, I do not know any PC or console games that relies on async reprojection to reduce input latency. While Comrade Stinger's demo is an illusion of the effect showcased in Unity, I think it sounds promising and dedicate this project to implementing it properly in a barebones demo using Direct3D 12.
