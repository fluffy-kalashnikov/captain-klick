# comrade-klick
Attempted implementation of async reprojection in Direct3D 12 inspired by [Comrade Stinger's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvFyOFacljg)
Unity demo project. The original idea stems from [3kliksphilip's video _DLSS 3 - What I think of it_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjPEdtd1g6I&t=539s),
with [3kliksphilip's video _The future of upscaling?_](https://youtu.be/f8piCZz0p-Y?si=wW5J-UH7uaueFEbK)
piquing my curiosity given the highlight of [Comrade Stinger's demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gjVWNzHF3Gddxb3fUNgEXU38ETuLfVM2/view).
